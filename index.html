            <p>If you want to truly advance your career and succeed as a developer, you need to market yourself. Sure,
                coding is
                your passion and you rather bury yourself in it, but how would anyone know that youâ€™re good at what you
                do
                or
                even discover you unless you put yourself out there?As a developer, you know that you need to keep
                practicing
                and refining your skills. What you might not know is that you can use the assignments and projects you
                do to
                creat e a portfolio that showcases your expertise.</p>
